# Random Forest Implementation
## Overview
This project implements a *Random Forest Classifier* to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary, using the "Social_Network_Ads" dataset from Kaggle. It compares the Random Forest model with a Decision Tree Classifier, evaluates performance, and includes data visualization.

For a more detailed description, see the `Document.pdf` file in this repository.
